                                    <p>On 1st September 2023, my regular workday began with me concentrating on the Site IT responsibilities that fill my routine, including tasks like ServiceNow Ticket Management, End User Support, software installations, and mapping printers. In parallel, my focus extended to the ongoing project of the Digi Voice Solution FAQs website, where I embarked on a crucial phase of UI (User Interface) development. I had worked on SharePoint Improvements in PES IT Homepage. Starting with the home page, I initiated several enhancements to make it more informative and user-friendly. Firstly, I incorporated an announcement section, ensuring that important updates and news were prominently displayed for easy access by site users. Additionally, I integrated a selection of self-help resources, empowered users with quick access to valuable information, guides, and troubleshooting materials. To enhance navigation, I added a collection of quick menus and links directly on the home page, simplifying the process of reaching commonly visited areas within the site. Moreover, I undertook the task of creating a new organizational chart, improving the site's visual representation of its structure and hierarchy. To infuse a fresh and engaging look, I applied a theme change, revitalizing the overall aesthetics of the page.</p>

As an additional task, I meticulously executed a disk-wiping procedure, often referred to as the "kill disk" process, on laptops designated for disposal or scrap, ensuring data security and privacy compliance. Moreover, my day was enriched by contributing to SharePoint enhancements, particularly on the Products and Services Main Page. In this endeavor, I orchestrated a strategic overhaul within the "Products and Services" section. To enhance user experience and accessibility, I introduced four distinct menus, each meticulously tailored to serve specific functions: PES Facility Ticket, Invoice List, Scrap Approval, and Donation Approval. These menus were not only thoughtfully designed for ease of use but also adorned with buttons and images, elevating the visual appeal of the section while making navigation more intuitive and engaging. This initiative aims to optimize user interactions and streamline processes on the SharePoint platform.</p>

In addition, I took proactive steps to prepare laptops for the new hires scheduled to join the team next week, ensuring that their onboarding experience would be smooth and efficient. Moreover, a significant part of my day involved a productive discussion with my supervisor regarding enhancements to the Digi Voice Solution FAQs page. During this meeting, my supervisor entrusted me with the task of adding a crucial announcement about Digi Phones, further enriching the user experience. In tandem with these responsibilities, I dedicated time to revamp the "FAQs" section comprehensively. I reorganized the frequently asked questions into three distinct menus on the primary FAQs page: General FAQ, Zoom FAQs, and Digi Voice Solution FAQs. </p>

Simultaneously, I diligently persisted in preparing laptops for the upcoming new hires scheduled to join the team next week, building a foundation for their seamless integration into the workforce. Furthermore, I focused on the final phase of the SharePoint improvements, which involved the implementation of a consistent footer across all pages. While seemingly a small detail, this addition had a significant impact on the user experience. The standardized footer not only enhanced the overall visual appeal but also provided essential information about the Site IT Support IT Team. Users could easily access names and contact details, simplifying the process of reaching out to the appropriate IT team member for assistance or inquiries. This enhancement contributed to a more user-friendly and responsive support system.</p>

                                    <p>On 19th September 2023, I had the opportunity to join a new team, the Mendix Development Team. It marked the beginning of an exciting journey into the realm of Mendix application development. On my first day, I had the opportunity to participate in a weekly staff meeting, which took place in the Denali Meeting Room, located in Zone A on Level 3. During the meeting, I was asked to introduce myself to my fellow colleagues. The meeting was convened to provide updates on the progress made during the previous week. Later on the day, I was introduced to various aspects of Mendix development, and one of the key highlights was diving into the intricacies of creating a Sample Application focused on CRUD operations. During my initial days with the Mendix Development Team, I had the chance to learn about and work on a Sample Application that revolved around the fundamental concept of CRUD, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This application served as an essential introduction to the core principles of Mendix development. It involved understanding how to create, retrieve, update, and delete data within the Mendix platform, a foundational skillset for building more complex and functional applications. As I delved into this Sample Application, I gained practical experience in designing user interfaces, defining data structures, and implementing the logic required for seamless data management.

                                    <span class="close-button" onclick="closeModal('modal14')">&times;</span>
                                    <p>On 20th September 2023, I learnt on modules roles and app security roles in Mendix. During this learning, I acquired a through grasp function that module roles fulfill within Mendix applications. Module roles were used to restrict access to specific modules or functionalities within an application. They allowed developers to group users based on their roles or responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized individuals could access particular parts of the application. For example, in an application, module roles might be defined for administrators, and users, each with different levels of access to the application's features. Security roles, on the other hand, provided a more fine-grained approach to access control. In the past, security roles allowed developers to define detailed permissions for entities, attributes, and microflows within the application. This level of granularity ensured that user access was precisely tailored to their roles and responsibilities. For instance, a security role could be configured to grant read-only access to certain data entities while allowing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on others. For the complexities of module roles and app security roles, I came to recognize their fundamental importance in ensuring the security of Mendix applications and efficiently controlling user access. The capability to establish and uphold these roles not only strengthens the application's security measures but also plays a substantial role in the development of resilient and trustworthy Mendix applications.</p>

                                    <p>On 21st September 2023, I had the valuable opportunity to delve into the intricacies of working with data grids. During this session, I learned about data grids, a fundamental component in Mendix application development. The data grid allowed developers to create tables or grids that showcased data from entities or data sets. It enabled users to view, sort, and filter data, enhancing their ability to interact with information effectively. For instance, in an employee management system, a data grid could display a list of employees with their names, roles, and contact details, making it easy for administrators to navigate and manage employee records. Meanwhile, Data grid 2 is an enhanced version, built upon the capabilities of the original data grid. It provided more advanced features for dynamic data presentation. This included features such as responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices, support for context menus, and improved data handling options. Developers could leverage data grid 2 to create highly interactive and responsive data tables that met the evolving needs of modern applications. Learning about data grid and data grid 2 provided me with an additional set of tools and skills to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces for complex applications. As I delved deeper into the intricacies of data grids and data grid 2, I realized their pivotal role in creating functional and visually appealing user interfaces within the Mendix platform. The ability to efficiently present and interact with data is a fundamental skill for Mendix developers, and the learning had equipped me with valuable insights and practical skills to excel in this aspect of application development. Amidst my learning activities, I had a meeting scheduled in the Rocky Meeting Room at Level 3, Zone A, with my supervisor. The purpose of this meeting was to provide an update on the progress I had made and to discuss what I had learned so far.</p>

                                    <p>On 22nd September, I had the chance to explore the required fields, range validations, and various attribute validations within the Mendix platform. These mechanisms played a crucial role in defining how data should be entered, processed, and validated in the past. Required fields were those that demanded specific data to be provided before an entity or object could be saved. They ensured that vital information was not omitted, contributing to the completeness of records. For example, in a user registration form, fields like 'Username' and 'Email' could be designated as required, ensuring that users couldn't proceed without supplying this essential information. I learned how to define and enforce required fields, ensuring that essential data is captured before proceeding, thus enhancing the quality and reliability of the applications I work on In addition, range validations allowed developers to define acceptable values or boundaries for numeric or date attributes. This ensured that data fell within predefined limits, enhancing data quality and preventing outliers. For instance, in an e-commerce application, a range validation might restrict the price of a product to a certain minimum and maximum value, guaranteeing that only reasonable prices could be set. Furthermore, various attribute validations encompassed a wide array of checks and constraints applied to attribute values. These validations could include pattern validations, which ensured that data adhered to specific formats, such as email addresses or phone numbers. They could also involve custom microflows or logic to validate data based on specific business rules. For instance, in a scheduling application, attribute validations might ensure that appointment times don't overlap or that resources aren't double-booked. These validation techniques are invaluable in creating robust and dependable Mendix applications. The ability to define and enforce these validations not only enhances the user experience but also contributes significantly to data quality and application reliability. </p>

                                    <p>On 25th September 2023, I learnt on how to do microflows in Mendix. I obtained an in-depth understanding of the concept of microflows and their crucial role in the development of Mendix applications. Microflows were the visual representations of custom logic used by developers to orchestrate actions and decisions within applications. They played a vital role in shaping how an application behaved by enabling the creation of sequential workflows triggered by various events, such as user interactions or changes in data. These workflows were instrumental in determining how data was processed, applying business rules, and executing specific tasks. Developers leveraged microflows to automate complex processes, validate data, and perform a wide range of operations, all of which contributed to enhancing the functionality and interactivity of Mendix applications. They were the backbone of application logic, allowing developers to design and implement the intricate behaviors that powered Mendix applications, providing a dynamic and user-centric experience. I learned how to create, configure, and implement microflows to perform a wide range of tasks, from data manipulation to workflow automation. I gained practical experience in creating microflows that addressed real-world scenarios, providing me with a solid foundation for developing efficient and user-friendly applications. Through the learning, I got to know their significance in streamlining business processes and enhancing the functionality of Mendix applications. Before ended the day, I had a scheduled meeting in the Matterhorn Meeting Room, situated in Zone F on Level 3, with my supervisor and my colleagues.

                                    <p>On 27th September 2023, I learned how to establish associations among entities in Mendix Applications. Associations referred to the relationships that could be defined between entities (data objects) in the data model. These associations were used to represent the connections or links between different types of data within the application. Associations were a fundamental part of modeling the data structure of the Mendix application and were essential for creating meaningful and interconnected data models. In Mendix, there were various types of associations that could be defined. One-to-One (1:1) associations represented single connections between two entities, where each instance of one entity linked to exactly one instance of another entity. One-to-Many (1:N) associations allowed each instance of one entity to relate to multiple instances of another entity, while each instance of the second entity was associated with only one instance of the first entity. Many-to-Many (N:N) associations allowed multiple instances of one entity to connect with multiple instances of another entity, often requiring the creation of a junction or "join" entity to facilitate this relationship. Associations were used to model complex data structures and were crucial for defining how different parts of my application's data interacted. Associations allowed developers to define relationships between entities within an application, enabling the representation of real-world connections between data. By defining associations, I was able to understand how data should have been retrieved, displayed, and manipulated within my application. This not only influenced the database schema but also affected how data was presented to users through user interfaces and how it was processed in microflows and other logic. In essence, associations served as the backbone of my application's data model, allowing me to create dynamic and interconnected applications. While I was engaged in my learning activities, I received an invitation to participate in the IT ECPP Monthly Get-Together. The main agenda of this meeting was to review the FY23 Intern programs and assign us to teams where we could collaborate for the upcoming monthly get-togethers.</p>

                                    <p>On 28th September 2023, I learnt on how to style the pages and button using CSS file in mendix. Styling the pages and buttons in Mendix applications using CSS was a common practice to achieve customized and visually appealing user interfaces. CSS provided developers with the flexibility to control the layout, design, and appearance of various elements within their applications. To style pages, developers typically included custom CSS rules in a dedicated CSS file. This file could be added to the Mendix project, and the classes defined within it could be applied to different pages or page elements using Mendix's CSS Classes property. For example, to change the background color of a specific page, developers would have defined a CSS class with the desired styling properties and then assigned that class to the page element in the Mendix Studio Pro. Similarly, styling buttons involved defining CSS rules for button elements. Developers could have created classes in the CSS file that specified properties like button color, font size, or hover effects. These classes could have been applied to buttons through the CSS Classes property, allowing for consistent and customized button styling throughout the application.</p>

With this tool, I could configure data mappings, validation rules, and transformations to ensure that Excel data seamlessly integrated with the application's data model. The module provided a user-friendly interface for uploading Excel files, defining mappings, and managing the import process, streamlining tasks such as bulk data entry and data synchronization. Conversely, the "Excel Exporter" module enabled the extraction of Mendix entity data into Excel format. It offered customization options for selecting data subsets, defining column structure, and specifying sorting criteria within the resulting Excel file. This functionality was incredibly valuable for generating reports, creating data backups, and sharing information in a format widely used in business contexts. In addition to the Excel-specific modules, I also leveraged the "Mx Reflection" module, which extended Mendix's capabilities. This module allowed me to dynamically inspect and manipulate Mendix objects at runtime, including entities and attributes. With "Mx Reflection," I could create flexible and adaptable solutions for handling Excel data that catered to evolving application requirements. These tools collectively empowered me to efficiently manage Excel data within Mendix applications, ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and accessibility. Whether it was importing external data or exporting application data for reporting purposes, these modules played a pivotal role in enhancing data-related processes within Mendix applications.</p>
