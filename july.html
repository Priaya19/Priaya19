                                    <p>On 3rd July 2023, I started my day with a laptop briefing session for the new onboarded employees. Additionally, I managed a series of tasks and responsibilities that align with my standard daily routine in Site IT Support. Moreover, I had the opportunity to learn something significant during the day, and it was creating a new user profile on your laptop using the Windows Registry Editor (regedit) involves several steps and requires caution, as editing the registry can impact your system's stability if done incorrectly. Before proceeding, ensure you have administrative privileges and back up your important data. To begin, open the Registry Editor by pressing Win + R, typing "regedit," and hitting Enter. Next, navigate to the Profile List by accessing the following registry key “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProgileList” and renamed the current profile as old. This key contains information about user profiles on your system and will be where you make the necessary changes. After making the required adjustments, restart the laptop and sign in to create a new profile account.</p>
