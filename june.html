                                    <p>On 1st June 2023, Starting the day by delved into the Site IT tasks as usual. Additionally, I assigned replacement laptops for those who have requested and scheduled appointment for today. For scrap flow, we worked on the second layer of approval which is Head Department Approval for IT and Finance. Today, I expanded my understanding how to obtain a group policy result, which required administrative access. To get the Group Policy Result for a Windows system, I logged in with administrative privileges. Then, I opened the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows key, typed "Command Prompt," and hit Enter. In the Command Prompt window, I executed the "gpresult /H" command. This command triggered the generation of a detailed report that showcased the Group Policies applied to the currently logged-in user and computer. I analyzed this report to verify that the correct policies were being implemented as intended. When necessary, I saved or exported the report to a text file using a command like "gpresult/H C:\users\3644957\gpresult.html" for future reference or sharing. This process was essential for administrators to ensure that Group Policies were properly configured and affecting the system as desired.</p>

                                    <p>On 2nd June 2023, I commenced the day by attending to my Site IT duties. Moreover, we Continued with the second layer of approval, specifically the Head Department Approval. I also prepared laptops for the upcoming new hires and interns scheduled for next week, including the allocation of replacement laptops as needed. One particularly notable piece of knowledge that I acquired was on how to create group signature in Microsoft Outlook. Creating a group signature in Microsoft Outlook involved several steps to ensure consistent representation for the team or organization. Began by opening Outlook and accessing its options. Then, composed a new email where designed and formatted the group signature, including text, images, and contact details. After designing, copied the signature, returned to Outlook options, and navigated to email signature settings. Pasted the signature there, assigned it a name, and set it as the default for new messages and replies. Saved the signature, composed a test email, and verified that it automatically appeared at the end of our messages. I could return to settings for further adjustments if necessary, ensuring a polished and unified group signature for our Outlook emails.</p>

                                    <p>On 6th June 2023, I initiated my day by assigning laptops to new onboards, ensuring they were set up and ready for usage. Following this, I proceeded with my usual tasks and responsibilities within the Site IT department, addressing various duties and responding to inquiries as part of my daily routine. For Scrap Flow, our focus shifted to the third layer of approval, which involves MRO Approval. This step necessitates arranging for a vendor site visit. Additionally, MRO is tasked with the crucial decision of determining whether the disposal should be categorized as sales disposal or cost disposal. Today I've obtained insights into how to update audio driver. To update audio drivers in HP laptops, you can follow these steps: First, identify your laptop's model and go to the official HP support website. Locate the "Drivers & Software" section and enter your laptop's details to find the latest audio driver compatible with your specific model and operating system. Download the driver and run the installer, following the on-screen instructions. After installation, restart your laptop to apply the changes. Additionally, you can also update audio drivers through the Device Manager on Windows by right-clicking on the audio device, selecting "Update driver," and choosing to search for updated drivers automatically. Keeping audio drivers up to date can resolve issues and improve sound performance on your HP laptop.</p>

                                    <p>On 7th June 2023, I began my workday by diving into the usual Site IT responsibilities. For Scrap Flow, our attention was directed towards the sales disposal aspect. In this context, the subsequent step involved obtaining MRO Approval, where attaching the necessary quotation was a vital requirement. Additionally, I arranged laptops for the new hires and interns slated for next week. Today, I learned how to create an archive file in Microsoft Outlook. Creating an archive file in Microsoft Outlook was a straightforward process. I began by opening Outlook and navigating to the "File" tab. From there, I selected "Options" and chose "Advanced." In the "AutoArchive" section, I clicked on "AutoArchive Settings." In the AutoArchive dialog box, I could specify the folder I wanted to archive and set the archive settings, such as how often I wanted items to be archived and where I wanted to store the archived items. Once I had configured my preferences, I clicked "OK." Outlook automatically archived the selected items based on my settings, helping me keep my mailbox organized and clutter-free.</p>

                                    <p>On 8th June 2023, I initiated my daily schedule by addressing the Site IT duties. For the Scrap Flow, our ongoing efforts were centered around advancing to the subsequent layer of approval, specifically the AR/EA approval stage. In this phase, it was imperative to attach the corresponding invoice for further processing. Throughout the day, I encountered a crucial piece of knowledge regarding the resolution of issues with the Windows File Explorer Search Box. When facing problems with this integral feature, it was important to follow a systematic approach to restore its functionality. Firstly, attempting a simple restart of File Explorer often worked wonders. This could be done by pressing “Ctrl + Shift + Esc” to access the Task Manager, locating "Windows Explorer" in the list of running processes, right-clicking it, and choosing the "Restart" option. If this quick fix didn't suffice, there was a built-in Windows Search Troubleshooter that could be employed. To access it, I navigated to Windows Settings, selected "Privacy & Security," and clicked on "Troubleshoot." Under "Find and fix other problems," I opted for "Search and Indexing" and ran the troubleshooter, which could automatically detect and resolve common search-related issues. If the problem persisted, I considered rebuilding the search index, as it could become corrupted over time and hinder the search box's effectiveness. I accessed the Indexing Options through Windows Settings, and under "More Search Indexer Settings," clicked on "Advanced Search Indexer Settings." From there, I went to the "Index Settings" tab and clicked "Rebuild," following the prompts to initiate the rebuilding process. This step could significantly improve search performance by creating a fresh index. Additionally, I ensured that the Windows Search service was functioning correctly. To do this, I opened the Run dialog by pressing “Win + R,” typed “services.msc,” and hit Enter. In the Services window, I located "Windows Search," right clicked it, and selected "Restart" if it was already running or "Start" if it wasn't. Checking for Windows Updates was another vital aspect of maintaining a smoothly operating search box, as updates often contained fixes for various issues, including search problems. To check for updates, I navigated to Windows Settings and selected "Update & Security." If none of these steps yielded positive results, it was worth considering the possibility of corrupted system files causing the problem. The System File Checker (SFC) tool could be employed for this purpose. I opened Command Prompt as an administrator, typed “sfc /scannow,” and pressed Enter. The SFC tool scanned and attempted to repair any corrupted system files. If the issue persisted, it was worth investigating whether the problem was user specific. Creating a new user profile could help determine if the problem was tied to a particular user account. Additionally, third-party software conflicts could be the root cause. Temporarily disabling or uninstalling such software could be a necessary step in identifying and resolving these conflicts. Finally, if none of these solutions proved effective, a System Restore to a point in time when the search box functioned properly could be considered as a last resort to rectify the issue and restore efficient searching capabilities to the Windows File Explorer Search Box.</p>

                                    <p>On 9th June 2023, I commenced the day by managing the Site IT responsibilities. I also continued setup the laptops for the new hires and interns scheduled for the upcoming week. Then, I and Shindujaah, had a meeting on Scrap Flow Discussion. Among the wealth of knowledge acquired that day, I gained insights into the process of granting access to a file in OneDrive for fellow colleagues. It began by selecting an existing file or creating a new one, ensuring that it was synchronized within OneDrive. Then, by simply right-clicking on the file, one could select the "Share" option. In the dialogue box that appeared, the names of the users in need of access were entered, accompanied by a brief message if desired. A final click on "Send" dispatched the access invitation. Crucially, the file's owner retained the capability to revoke access for specific users should the need arise, providing a robust and flexible access control mechanism.</p>

                                    <p>On the 12th of June 2023, my day kicked off with the distribution of laptops to new hires, ensuring their readiness for use. Following this, I diligently attended to my routine responsibilities within the Site IT department, addressing various tasks and responding to inquiries as per my daily routine. In parallel, we made progress in the Scrap Flow process, specifically focusing on the subsequent layer, where MRO was responsible for attaching the payment receipt. Furthermore, I also learnt on how to solve SAP Image View Issue. To resolve the SAP Image View Issue related to Adobe Acrobat, the recommended solution involved uninstalling and then reinstalling Adobe Acrobat through the software center. This process ensured that had a fresh and functional installation of Adobe Acrobat, which could help resolve compatibility or integration issues with SAP. To begin, accessed the computer's control panel, navigated to the list of installed programs, and uninstalled Adobe Acrobat. Next, downloaded the latest version of Adobe Acrobat from the official website, ensuring compatibility with my operating system. Ran the installer and followed the on-screen instructions to reinstall Adobe Acrobat. After installation, restarted the computer to ensure all changes took effect. Finally, launched SAP and attempted to view images or documents that were previously problematic. This reinstallation process often resulted in a seamless integration between Adobe Acrobat and SAP, allowing for smooth document viewing and resolving any SAP Image View Issues encountered.</p>

In relation to the Scrap Flow, our focus shifted to the subsequent stage, where MRO took charge of arranging the collection of laptops. Additionally, I took steps to set up new laptops for the upcoming batch of new hires scheduled for the following week.
