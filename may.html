                                    <p>On 5th May 2023, my typical workday used to begin with the standard Site IT tasks, which involved managing incident tickets and service request tickets, as well as assisting users remotely through remote desktop support. In my role as a Site IT team member, I was responsible for addressing and resolving various technical issues and requests reported by users within the organization. I participated in the ECPP (Early Career Programme) Review and Retrospective session virtually. During this session, we focused on the progress of our case study projects and collaboratively shared the work completed by each team member. The purpose was to gather the final valuable feedback and insights from other participants to enhance the quality of our work and ensure that the case study projects were on track and aligned with the program's objectives before the presentation.</p>

                                    <p>On 8th May 2023, I commenced my usual workday, giving priority to the Site IT duties that constitute my routine, including tasks like ServiceNow Ticket Management, End User Support, and mapping the printers. Additionally, I was tasked with assigning laptops for the new hires, ensuring they had the necessary equipment and access to begin their roles effectively. Later in the day, I joined the ECPP Case Study Planning meeting, during which we reviewed the slides that had been prepared by each team member in the past. For donation approval flow, once we have created the approval for HR provide estimation date, we continued to work on approvals from the head departments, namely IT and Finance. Today, I learned how to set up Okta Verify on new phones. The first step was to access the "Okta Admin" panel, where I searched for the user's employee ID and navigated to their profile page. Then, I clicked on the "Reset" option and selected "Okta Verify" from the menu. After that, I proceeded to the user's Okta Settings, scrolled down to locate the "Okta Verify" section, and clicked on "Set Up." The user was then required to scan the provided QR code using their phone to complete the setup process.</p>

                                    <p>On 9th May 2023, my day typically began with my regular Site IT responsibilities. Furthermore, I was involved in the process of setting up laptops for the new hires who are scheduled to join Jabil next week. For donation approval flow, we continued to work on Head of Department approval. Today I had opportunity to learned on how to rename the computer in easiest way. To accomplish this, I logged into the laptop using an Admin ID and password, granting the necessary permissions. I then opened File Explorer, right clicked on "This PC," and selected "Properties." Scrolling down, I located the "Rename This PC (Advanced)" option. Here, I executed the computer's renaming process, changing the PC name to a desired one and adjusting the domain to "Jabil." After completing the renaming, I initiated a laptop restart to apply the changes. Subsequently, I accessed Active Directory (AD) from my laptop and located the laptop's hostname, followed by modifying its location. To achieve this, I double-clicked on the computer name, selected "move," and designated "JBL Computers," "Asia," and finally "Penang GBC" as the new location. This process ensured an organized and accurate representation of the computer's location within the network.</p>

                                    <p>On 10th May 2023, I routinely began my daily work with my Site IT obligations. I also continued the process of setting up the remaining laptops for the new hires scheduled to join next week, as well as for replacement laptops. I participated in a demo presentation meeting as part of my preparation for the ECP Programme presentation scheduled for tomorrow. During the meeting, I engaged in practice sessions and received valuable feedback to refine my presentation skills and content. Today, I gained knowledge on how to resolve the issue when the personal admin is not working. To resolve the issue when the personal admin was not working, I followed a series of steps. First, opened the computer management on the laptop where the problem was occurring and ran it as an administrator. This action prompted a sign-in request, where I inserted the admin ID and password. Next, it navigated to the local groups and selected "administrator." From there, I added the "PEN Admins" group. Another sign-in prompt appeared and used my own account ID and password this time. After completing these steps, required to signed out and then signed back in to ensure that the access was functioning correctly.</p>

                                    <p>On 11th May 2023, I attended the ECPP Programme. The ECP (Early Career Programme) event unfolded at 8:50 AM in Jabil Building's Level 3 Everest Meeting Room. The event commenced with an opening speech by Patrick. Subsequently, the presentation sessions began, with each team being allocated 30 minutes for their presentations, followed by a Q&A session. Team 1, led by Edson Ang, delivered their presentation, followed by Team 2, led by Ng Kar Kai. A 15-minute tea break was then scheduled to provide participants with a brief respite. The event resumed with my team, Team 3, led by Kang Chien Loong, presenting our presentation. Team 4, led by Shindujaah, followed with their presentation. After a lunch break, there was a group photo session and a prize-giving ceremony, during which my team was honored with the 2nd prize. Following the ECP event, I continued with my Site IT responsibilities, managed service request tickets and incident tickets.</p>

                                    <p>On 15th May 2023, my day began by assigning laptops for new hires, ensuring they were set up and ready for use. Following this, I attended to my standard responsibilities in Site IT, addressing various tasks and inquiries as part of my regular duties. For donation approval flow, we proceeded to the next layer of approval which involved HR. In this phase, HR was required to provide information regarding the collection date. This step marked an essential part of the approval process, ensuring that all necessary details were provided and reviewed before proceeding with the donation-related activities. Today’s knowledge about Microsoft Power BI and the process of installation. Microsoft Power BI, commonly known as Power BI, is a suite of business analytics tools and services developed by Microsoft. It provides a comprehensive platform for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence. There are several steps to install. It began with opening a web browser and searching for "download Power BI Desktop" in Google. This led me to the official Microsoft Power BI download page. From there, I selected "Advanced download options" for Microsoft Power BI Desktop and clicked the download button, which allowed me to choose the "PBIDesktopSetup_x64.exe" version for download. After the download completed, I ran the application and proceeded with the installation. Following the installation, I signed in using my Jabil email, and the installation process was successfully completed.</p>

                                    <p>On 16th May 2023, I initiated my morning by tending to my regular Site IT tasks. For donation approval flow, I and my colleague focused on the subsequent layer, which involved FA closing. This step required attaching an outgoing pass to the donation form as part of the process. Additionally, I worked on to setup new laptops for the incoming hires scheduled for the upcoming week. During the day, I acquired knowledge regarding the resolution of issues related to Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Office when they were not functioning correctly. To address these problems, I followed a specific set of steps. Initially, I accessed the Windows Search feature and searched for "Internet Options." Once opened, I navigated to the "Advanced" tab and scrolled down to the end of the settings list. There, I selected all the "TLS" options from 1.0 to 1.3 and applied these changes. This adjustment was a crucial part of troubleshooting and ensuring the proper functioning of Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Office.</p>

                                    <p>On 17th May 2023, as usual my kicked off with my routine responsibilities in Site IT. Moreover, I also dedicated time to the ongoing donation approval flow. Additionally, I setup some surplus laptops to be made available for loan to our users. In the evening, I participated in the Jabil GBS Toastmasters Club's bi-weekly meeting, where I fulfilled my role as the Microsoft Team Master. As today’s learning, I gained knowledge on how to install OFD Reader software. I initiated the procedure by accessing the Windows search and entering "//mypesit003." This led me to the software folder, then opened the folder and find for "OFD Reader" folder. Upon finding it, I clicked on the application file and executed it to commence the installation. Once the installation was complete, I proceeded to the Control Panel, where I navigated to the Region settings. Within the administrative tab, I selected "Change System Locale," which prompted me to enter my admin ID and password. then changed the current system locale from "English (United States)" to "Chinese (Simplified, China)" and confirmed the change by clicking "Ok." Finally, a system restart was required to complete the installation.</p>

                                    <p>On 18th May 2023, I usually began my workday by addressing my recurring tasks within Site IT. For Donation Approval, we successfully completed the approval process for donations, ensuring that all layers of the approval hierarchy were addressed. Subsequently, we did test run to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the donation approval workflow. Throughout the testing phase allowed us to identify and address any potential issues. For today’s learning, I gained knowledge on how to replace the RAM and SSD. Replacing RAM and SSD in laptops was generally a straightforward process, but it could vary slightly depending on the specific laptop model. To start, you prepared a clean and well-lit workspace, shut down your laptop, and disconnected all cables and peripherals. You ensured you had compatible replacement RAM and SSD on hand. Most laptops featured a removable bottom panel secured with screws, which you could remove by referring to your laptop's user manual or online resources. You carefully handled the screws to avoid stripping them. The process began with replacing the RAM. RAM slots on the laptop's motherboard were located, and the retention clips on either side of the old RAM module were released. The old RAM was gently removed, and the new one was inserted, ensuring it was properly seated. Pressure was applied firmly until the retention clips audibly clicked into place. Next, the SSD was replaced, typically found in either an M.2 or 2.5-inch drive bay. For an M.2 SSD, the retaining screw was gently removed, and the old SSD was slid out. The new SSD was then inserted in the same orientation and secured with the screw. If it was a 2.5-inch SSD, any securing screws or brackets were removed, the SATA and power cables were disconnected, and the old SSD was replaced with the new one. All cables were reconnected, and the new SSD was secured in place.</p>

                                    <p>On 19th May 2023, starting the day by dove into the Site IT tasks. In addition to my workload today, I had the responsibility of providing replacement laptops to users who had previously requested them. Later in the day, I and Shindu convened a meeting with my supervisor, CH Lee, and my colleague, Jason to discuss updates and testing related to the donation approval flow. During the meeting, my colleague, Jason asked us to check on looping back the approval for few layers in Microsoft Automate. After the meeting, we diligently examined the existing flows to determine if there were any potential ways to facilitate these loopbacks. Today, I acquired valuable knowledge on resolving the issue of a user being unable to connect to an external display. The process involved a few crucial steps, starting with identifying the specific laptop model and Windows version. Armed with this information, I navigated to the HP portal, where I located and downloaded the graphics driver. The process involved downloading and executing the driver, a vital step in ensuring a seamless connection to the external display. With the drivers in hand, I seamlessly ran the installation process, ensuring a smooth and successful connection to the external display. This experience not only broadened my technical skills but also highlighted the satisfaction of troubleshooting and delivering effective solutions.</p>

                                    <p>On 22nd May 2023, my day commenced with the allocation of laptops to new hires, ensuring their readiness for use. Subsequently, I proceeded to carry out my routine responsibilities within the Site IT department, tending to various tasks and addressing inquiries as part of my standard duties. Today I gained knowledge on how to resolve the issue when users faced with the issue of the Windows Search Bar not working, it could be a frustrating experience, but there were several steps you could take to resolve it. Firstly, restarting your computer often fixed minor glitches. If that didn't help, you could have used the Windows Search Troubleshooter in Windows Settings to automatically detect and fix issues. If the problem persisted, consider rebuilding the search index through Indexing Options in Windows Settings to boost performance. Ensure the Windows Search service was running correctly in the Services window. Keep Windows updated, as updates usually contain fixes. If needed, use the System File Checker tool in Command Prompt as an admin to repair system files. Firstly, restarting your computer is usually the initial step for resolving minor glitches. If that didn't work, you could use the Windows Search Troubleshooter through Windows Settings > "Privacy & Security" > "Troubleshoot" > "Find and fix other problems" > "Search and Indexing." This tool automatically detected and repaired common search-related issues. If the problem persisted, you might have considered rebuilding the search index via Indexing Options in Windows Settings. By clicking on "Advanced Search Indexer Settings", selecting the "Index Settings" tab, and clicking "Rebuild", you could significantly improve search performance. Additionally, ensuring the Windows Search service functioned correctly could be achieved by opening the Run dialog (Win + R), typing "services.msc", and hitting Enter. In the Services window, you could have located "Windows Search," right clicked it, and chosen "Restart" if it was running or "Start" if it wasn't. Keeping Windows up to date was crucial, as updates often included fixes for various issues, including search problems. Accessing Windows Settings, selecting "Update & Security," and choosing "Windows Update" checked for updates. If none of these solutions worked, considering the possibility of corrupted system files causing the problem was advisable. The System File Checker (SFC) tool could have been used. You could have opened Command Prompt as an administrator, typed "sfc /scannow", and pressed Enter. The SFC tool would have scanned and attempted to repair any corrupted system files. If the issue persisted, you could have checked if it was user specific. Creating a new user profile could have helped determine if the issue was tied to a specific user account. Additionally, third-party software conflicts might have caused the problem. Temporarily disabling or uninstalling such software may have been necessary to identify and resolve these conflicts. Finally, if none of these steps had produced positive results, a System Restore to a point in time when the search bar worked correctly could have been considered as a last resort to rectify the issue and restore efficient searching capabilities to the Windows Search Bar.</p>

                                    <p>On 23rd May 2023, I initiated my daily routine with the standard Site IT duties. In the context of the Donation flow, we actively worked on a specific aspect of the process, which involved implementing a loopback mechanism for approvals within a few layers of the flows. During the day, I embarked on a journey of knowledge, where I discovered about claiming warranties for laptops. The process was elegantly simple yet crucial. The initial step involved gathering the serial numbers of the laptops, followed by a visit to the HP Check Warranty Portal to determine their warranty status. Concurrently, I obtained the employee ID associated with each laptop. Subsequently, I collated all this pertinent information and shared it with Jason, along with a note specifying whether it was a warranty or non-warranty claim. This proactive approach ensured that Jason could efficiently initiate the necessary case procedures, streamlining the warranty claim process.</p>

                                    <p>On 24th May 2023, my workdays typically began with Site IT duties. Additionally, I was responsible for setting up surplus laptops for replacement and making them available for loan to users. Moreover, we carried out a comprehensive testing phase for the Donation Flow, with a specific focus on verifying that all essential approvals were correctly initiated following the implementation of the looping mechanism. During this testing process, it became evident that the flow encountered a failure point. This was primarily attributed to limitations within Microsoft Power Automate, particularly with regard to nesting approvals. In response to this obstacle, we embarked on a proactive effort to explore alternative solutions. Furthermore, my learning experience from today was discovering how to resolve the issue when the Excel sheet tab was unable to right-click. To address this problem, I followed a specific procedure, starting by closing the Excel Application. Then, I opened the File Explorer or used the Windows search bar to navigate to "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel" and deleted the "Excel5.xlb" file. Finally, I reopened the Excel application, and this corrective action successfully restored the right-click functionality to the sheet tabs, enhancing efficiency in working with Excel spreadsheets.</p>

One of my primary responsibilities for the day involved setting up new laptops for incoming hires and interns who are scheduled to join our team next week. Simultaneously, within the scope of the Donation Flow project, we dedicated time to research and gather resources related to the implementation of looping mechanisms. Moreover, during the day, I gained valuable insights into the resolution process for user accounts that had been disabled. The initial step in this process involved creating a CSV file containing the affected user's employee ID. Subsequently, I accessed the ServiceNow portal, where I located the "Re-Enable AD" option. Here, I diligently filled in the requisite fields and attached the CSV file. Upon submitting the ticket, the request for account re-enablement was officially initiated. As the ticket progressed through the system, it underwent the necessary processing steps. Once the ticket was successfully processed and subsequently closed, it indicated the successful re-enablement of the user's account. This process ensured that the affected user regained access to their resources and privileges, thus maintaining the integrity of their user account.</p>

Then, I proceeded to carry on with the task from the previous day, which involved setting up new laptops for the incoming hires and interns scheduled to join us next week. In our efforts to enhance the Donation Flow, we initially attempted to implement looping back functions for a few layers using a switch case approach. Unfortunately, this method proved to be unsuccessful as we encountered difficulties and the flow could not be successfully implemented. After careful consideration and assessment of the situation, we made the decision to revert to the original flow, which had been functioning without errors. We did make some enhancements to the flow as part of our continuous improvement efforts Additionally, I took the opportunity today to expand my knowledge by delving into the realm of CDM (Customer Data Management) Software Installation. To initiate this learning process, I began by accessing the server labeled \MYPESIT003. Once there, I navigated to the designated folder, aptly named CDM, and further accessed the subfolder, CDM 2.1.3. Within this subfolder, I executed the CDM application. Before running the application, I ensured to log in with administrative privileges. Subsequently, I meticulously followed the instructions provided within the folder to successfully complete the CDM software installation process.</p>

For donation flow, we successfully concluded the flow, and our attention shifted towards the scrap flow. We examined the provided information to ensure a smooth transition into this phase. Today, I learnt on how to install different language in Adobe Acrobat. To install a different language in Adobe Acrobat, you followed these steps. Opened the Adobe Acrobat on the computer and checked the currently selected language in the preferences. Then, proceeded to the Adobe website to download the corresponding language pack. After downloading the language pack, executed the installation file and followed the on-screen instructions. Subsequently, restarted Adobe Acrobat, allowing it to recognize the newly installed language pack. To change the language within Adobe Acrobat, accessed to the preferences (under "Edit" on Windows or "Acrobat" on macOS), selected the "International" or "Language" section, and chose your newly installed language from the options. Finally, restarted Adobe Acrobat once more to apply the language changes. It's important to note that not all languages may be available as language packs, and making system-wide language changes might have necessitated logging out or restarting the computer.</p>
