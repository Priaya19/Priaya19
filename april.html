                                    <p>On 3rd April 2023, I started my first day of internship at Jabil Sdn Bhd. 
                                        Commencing my duties, I checked in at the Jabil Security Check Point at 7:45 am, 
                                        where I was provided with a temporary ID. The security then directed both my colleagues 
                                        and me to convene at the Level 4 meeting room. During this session, I and my colleagues 
                                        were informed that there will be orientation for 2 days. Breakfast was provided for all the interns. 
                                        Then orientation was began at 8.30am. Each of us was furnished with laptops, which we subsequently 
                                        configured under the guidance of the Site IT Support Team. Proceeding with the day's agenda, the HR 
                                        department escorted us to the Level 3 Security Room for a badge photoshoot, a step essential for our 
                                        identification badges. The orientation progressed to encompass an Introduction to Jabil and EHS session. 
                                        HR personnel, TA personnel, and an in-person introduction by the nurse were conducted by the HR Manager. 
                                        Following a break for lunch, the orientation persisted, delving into topics encompassing the organizational chart, 
                                        employee benefits and compensation, medical benefits, employee engagement, as well as facilities and security measures.</p>

                                    <p>On 4th April 2023, the orientation day kicked off promptly at 9 am, covering a wide range of topics such as talent acquisition, 
                                        learning and development initiatives, industrial relations dynamics, GBS site IT support assistance, Concur expense training, 
                                        and insights into indirect procurement strategies. The morning session laid a strong foundation, providing essential insights 
                                        into various aspects of the company. After a refreshing lunch break, the orientation continued with a focus on Information Technology, 
                                        Finance, and the intricacies of Supply Chain and Procurement. These afternoon sessions contributed to a more comprehensive understanding 
                                        of the company's operations and functional areas. Following the informative sessions, I was assigned to the Site IT Support team, marking
                                         the culmination of a productive day. My supervisor then took me on a tour, introducing me to the various IT Zones and the Server Room. 
                                         Racheal Teoh, responsible for intern hiring at Jabil, also provided an overview of the Early Career Programme. This program, functioning
                                          as a graduate program, is meticulously structured to support recent graduates as they embark on their careers. It aims to enhance 
                                          participants' skills, expand their knowledge, and foster overall professional growth.</p>

                                    <p>On 5th April 2023, I had the privilege of receiving a comprehensive explanation from my supervisor about the Site IT Helpdesk roles and their operation within the context of Jabil. During this enlightening session, my supervisor delved into the specifics, outlining the precise responsibilities and functions associated with the Site IT Helpdesk position within our company. They also provided insights into the workflow, procedures, and protocols governing the IT Helpdesk's operations, emphasizing its integral role within Jabil's expansive IT infrastructure. This detailed discussion proved invaluable in enhancing my understanding of my role and its broader organizational significance. Furthermore, today I learnt on the process of handling Accessories Request tickets. These requests typically involve items such as laptops, headsets, mice, monitors, and similar equipment, all managed through the ServiceNow platform. During this instructive session, Jason informed me about the importance of documenting each request in an Excel spreadsheet known as the "Mayang Inventory”. The "Mayang Inventory" Excel sheet serves as a central repository for tracking and managing these requests. By diligently recording each request in this inventory, the team can maintain a detailed and organized record of all accessory-related transactions. This meticulous record-keeping ensures transparency, efficient tracking, and effective management of these requests, ultimately contributing to the overall seamless operation of our processes.</p>

                                    <p>On April 6th, 2023, I had a highly productive day in the IT department, where I undertook a diverse range of responsibilities. A significant portion of my day was dedicated to handling accessories request tickets. I also had the opportunity to learned how to use Active Directory and understand its myriad uses. Active Directory played a pivotal role as the backbone of Site IT Support, simplifying tasks such as user management, group policy management, and resource allocation, all while enhancing security within the organization's network environment. Furthermore, I was granted an account for logging in. In addition to Active Directory, I gained valuable insights into the processes of reimaging new laptops with the latest version of the Windows Operating System used by Jabil and formatting surplus laptops. For new laptops, this entailed the meticulous removal of any pre-existing data or configurations to provide a clean slate for the new users. Formatting and reimaging surplus laptops involved initiating the process by deleting the hostname from both Active Directory (AD) and the Orchestration Console, ensuring the removal of any prior user associations and configurations. After successfully erasing the hostname, the surplus laptops underwent re-imaging, which included the installation of a standardized operating system and software configuration to meet the organization's standards and security requirements. This typically involved deploying the latest Windows Operating System, performing necessary driver installations, and configuring essential software applications, making the laptops fully optimized for potential reuse or redistribution. Both processes ensured that the laptops were equipped with the latest security features, updates, and required software for efficient operation within the company's IT environment. With the knowledge gained on that day, I successfully re-imaged several laptops, contributing to our IT operations.</p>

                                    <p>On 7th April 2023, I started my day with handling ServiceNow accessories request and setup new laptops for new hires. My supervisor provided me with detailed guidance on how to utilize Okta Admin for various administrative tasks, such as resetting passwords and unlocking user accounts. Okta Admin is an identity and access management platform that allows administrators to manage user identities and access privileges efficiently. With the knowledge I acquired, I assisted several users in unlocking their accounts and resetting their passwords. Before the day ended, my supervisor provided me with guidance and instruction on how to manage time records effectively. As per his advice, I am required to record my timecards in the ServiceNow portal at the end of each week. This process involves inputting specific details, including the task name and the number of hours spent on each task. Essentially, the timecard serves as a record of the work I've completed throughout the week. It allows for a systematic and organized way of tracking how I've allocated my time to various tasks or projects. By specifying the task name and the corresponding hours worked, I can provide a detailed account of my activities, which is not only useful for tracking my own productivity but also for the broader management and reporting of work-related activities within the organization.</p>

                                    <p>On 10th April 2023, I began my day by assigning laptops to new hires with the guidance of my colleague, Jason. The process of assigning laptops involved obtaining their employee IDs and then search for them in Okta Admin to acquire temporary password. Once users received their temporary password, they were required to change them to new passwords following the password requirements. After logging in, I was required to install the required software by the new hires. Once the software installation was completed, I provided the users with the necessary laptop accessories. Continuing with my day, I managed ServiceNow accessories tickets, assisted with unlocking accounts, and facilitated password resets. At 2pm, I joined the PEN GBS Weekly Site IT meeting, a regular gathering that brought together the Site IT staff at Jabil. During the meeting, we discussed vital topics to ensure the effectiveness of IT operations and internal communication. My supervisor introduced me to a new intern, Shindujaah, who had joined the team earlier. One key agenda item was the review of Incident tickets, involving the analysis of reported incidents, their statuses, and compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This data-driven assessment allowed us to identify trends, potential improvements, and ensure prompt and efficient resolution of IT issues. We also focused on Service Request (SR) tickets, evaluating their volume, nature, and statuses, facilitating the tracking and management of service and resource requests. The meeting included a review of ongoing IT projects, providing updates on progress, addressing challenges, and confirming alignment with the organization's broader goals. Towards the meeting's end, my supervisor asked me to share my experiences from my first week at Jabil.</p>

                                    <p>On 11th April 2023, my day began by assisting a user who had encountered an account lock issue and required a password reset. Additionally, I also managed ServiceNow accessories requests. I also took the initiative to set up several surplus and new laptops for the upcoming hires next week. Today, I learned how to "killdisk" laptops before moving them into the scrap, and I successfully completed the killdisk procedure on a number of laptops. The process involved securely wiping the hard drives or SSDs to ensure that all data was irretrievable, rendering the devices safe for disposal. This crucial step in data security ensured that sensitive information couldn't be accessed once the laptops had become obsolete and were no longer in use. It was a productive day where I gained valuable hands-on experience in properly disposing of electronic equipment while safeguarding sensitive data.</p>

                                    <p>On 12th April 2023, I started my day by managed user's accessories requests. Assisted end-users with technical problems, providing guidance and step-by-step instructions to help them overcome technical hurdles and ensure their issues were resolved satisfactorily. I also undertook the responsibility of performing laptop wipes using the KillDisk software. Today, I learned how to map a printer from the server “\\azapseprn01”.
